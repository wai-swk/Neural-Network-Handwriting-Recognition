# Neural-Network-Handwriting-Recognition
The purpose of this project is to explore the design and training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with some preprocessed and formatted real-world data.

A multi-layer neural network and backpropagation are used to train the MNIST Database of handwritten digits.
