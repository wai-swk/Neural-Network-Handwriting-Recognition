# Neural-Network-Handwriting-Recognition
The purpose of this project is to explore the design and training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with some preprocessed and formatted real-world data.

In this project, a multi-layer neural network and backpropagation are used to train the MNIST Database of handwritten digits.

Please see [this report](MNIST_ANN_report.pdf) for detailed methods and results. This network achieves 97% recognition accuracy on the testing set.
